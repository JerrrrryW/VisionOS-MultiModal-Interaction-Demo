Head and Hand Tracking on the Apple Vision Pro
===========
Welcome! I didn't find any minimal code examples for hand and head tracking on Vision Pro, so I wrote one myself. The app places markers on each hand joint (and one elbow joint), and places an object above you that does tracks your head. 

The VisionOS requires an immersive space in order to do custom gestures / ARKit tracking, so you won't be able to write gestures that work system-wide unfortunately. I wanted to enhance the AVP navigational experience using weird gestures, so please let me know if you figure out something that works. 

The code is written to be easily understood and extended â€” build whatever you want! Replace the spheres with cubes! Do custom gestures! 

Have fun!
